# Hand Track Synchronizer

A pipeline for frame-accurate synchronization of egocentric video with 3D hand pose data.

## Description
This project aims to rebuild a video-motion synchronization system to align egocentric video frames with 3D hand pose motion data (JSON logs), creating frame-accurate synchronized datasets for training.

## Features
- Extract precise frame timestamps from video
- Match and interpolate 3D hand poses to video timelines
- Handle calibration challenges involving 3D pose projection and timestamp alignment
- Generate raw and synced pose visualizations

## Usage
(Instructions to be added)
